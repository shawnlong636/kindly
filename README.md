- **Boost Team Morale**: Smooth out those rough edges and keep conversations upbeat!



## **Getting Started ðŸš€**

Adding kindly to your Slack workspace is quick and easy! Or, well..., it will be. Once it's done. So stay tuned and we'll update the link soon!



## **Usage**

- **Enable the kindly filter**: /kindly enable @username or /kindly enable #channel

The app will automatically adjust the tone of messages from the selected users or in the specified channels to be more positive and friendly.



## Development

This repository is *source available* for those who are curious about how kindly works under the hood or want to contribute. Please note that this code is designed for the hosted version of kindly, and we recommend adding our hosted app to your Slack workspace rather than self-hosting.



## **Contributing**

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if youâ€™d like to improve kindly.
